Edit RRGGBBII Colour Palettes for ColourPET+G board

Lets you define up to 256 different palettes to convert the 4-bit RGBI to an 8-bit RRGGBBII analog RGB format.
Each R,G,B and I is 2-bits, giving 4 possible values. When combined they can generate 256 colours that can
be shown on an analog RGB monitor such as the Commodore 1084.
