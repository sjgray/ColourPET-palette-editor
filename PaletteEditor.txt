RRGGBBII Palette Editor (C)2016, Steve J. Gray
==============================================

INTRODUCTION
------------

This is a simple editor for generating a PALETTE ROM for my ColourPET+G board.
Colours are generated on the board in RGBI format. 4 bits are assigned to the
foreground colour and 4 bits for the background colour. 4 bits gives 16 colours.
The ColourPET+G board takes the 4 bits and feeds those into the PALETTE ROM
along with the palette selector byte. This gives 256 palettes of 16 colour each.
Each colour is 8 bits in the form RRGGBBII, giving 256 possible colours
(although some colours may be duplicated due to DAC resistor values).

OPERATION
---------

There are three sections in the window. There is the TOP control section,
middle Palette section, and bottom Entry section.

CONTROL SECTION
---------------

On the control section are LOAD, SAVE and ABOUT buttons.
ABOUT will display the program version, date and copyright.
LOAD will load the palette rom file "palette.bin".
SAVE will save back to the same file.

PALETTE SECTION
---------------

On the palette section are the palette selector, 16 colour boxes, and
several operation boxes that act on one or more colours.  At the top left
in blue, is the palette number. Use the up/down arrows below to select
one of the 256 palettes to edit. The "<" and ">" buttons select an entry
to edit. The selected entry will have a red box around it. You may also
click on the entry.

 Colours are labelled 0 to F. Using the RGBI colour model, the 0 to 7 row
are "normal" colours, and the 8 to F row are "bright" colours (intensity
bit set). However, when defining a palette any of the 256 colours can be
put in any colour box. The "Copy Palette" button copies the 16 current
colours. The "Paste Palette" pastes the 16 saved colours. You can use
this to duplicate palettes, or simply save a snapshot of the palette
incase you make a mistake and need to revert back. At the bottom are
several operation boxes. The "Scope" lets you select if operations are
performed on all colour entries, the first 8 (top), or the last 8 (bottom):

DEFAULT - Restores the palette to standard RGBI equivilent values.
CLEAR - Sets colours to black.
BRIGHTER - Increases the brightness.
DARKER - Reduces the brightness.
PASTE - Copies the saved colour.

ENTRY SECTION
-------------

The entry section lets you edit the selected colour entry. On the left
is a large box with the selected colour. Beside it are 4 sliders to adjust
R,G,B and I components. Each component can have a value of 0 to 3. The R,G,B
components determine the chroma component, and the I determines the hue.
To the right is the index number of the combined RGBI values. The "Copy Colour"
button memorizes the current colour values/index. The "Paste Colour" button
restores the saved value to the current colour. Beside the big box on the left
is a "<" label/button. Click it to toggle the Colour Picker on or off. The 
colour picker shows all 256 possible colours. Clicking on it to select a colour.
Click on the ">" button to toggle the picker back off and view the colour.

USING THE PALETTES
------------------

When you save you will get a binary file. The file contains 255 x 16 = 4096 bytes
and can be burned to a 2716 EPROM for use on the ColourPET+G board.
